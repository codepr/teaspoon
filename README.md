Teaspoon
========

Just a super small-sized in-memory timeseries database, it's the rust port of
[tts](https://github.com/codepr/tts.git), made to learn the language, play with
it and to make a comparison with C developing, in terms of difficulties,
productivity and performances as well.

Still at the very early stages, pretty poor rust code inside.
